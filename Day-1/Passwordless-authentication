## 🚀 Steps

### 1️⃣ Update SSH Configuration (Cloud Image Settings)
Open the config file:  
```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf


Change this line:  PasswordAuthentication yes

Go to line 64 in the main SSH config file: sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Ensure this line is set: PasswordAuthentication yes

Apply the changes by restarting SSH: sudo systemctl restart ssh

Set a password for the ubuntu user: sudo passwd ubuntu

Copy your SSH key to the server: ssh-copy-id ubuntu@<public-ip>

Finally, log in using SSH: ssh ubuntu@<public-ip>
